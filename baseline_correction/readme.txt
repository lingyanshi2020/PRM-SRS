Parametric warping functions

These are Matlab functions that implement Parametric Time Warping
as presented in the paper by Paul Eilers.

Run warpdemo.m to see the functions in use and to get graphical
results. The data consist of 16 calibration chromatograms that
were kindly provided by Claire Boucon and Sijmen de JOng of
Unilever Research.
